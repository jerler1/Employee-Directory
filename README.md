#### **Installation**

---

To intall this application using prebuilt html and css elements involved this:

1. Install the npm dependencies.
1. Type node server.js.

OR

1. Access the deployed site [here](https://jerler1.github.io/Employee-Directory/)

#### **Trials**

---
This is my first time using react, and I learned a lot.  Building components really helped keep the app from getting majorly cluttered.  

#### **Usage**

---

When you access the deployed website or start the react server.  There are a number of columns (Image, Name, Phone, Email, and DOB) 
and a search input.  If you type anything into the search input it will filter the results that are shown below.  If you click any of the
table headers it will sort that column.  There isn't a sort on the image column.

#### **Credits**

---

Thanks to my classmates Kyle, Tony, and Bradley for the filter debug help.
